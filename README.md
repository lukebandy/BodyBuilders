# BodyBuilders
Created as part of Global Game Jam 2020

You are the A.I. of an interstellar spaceship, in charge of looking after the passengers. But oh no! You've accidentally dismembered them all. See if you can fix everyone back together before you reach Earth and everyone sees what you've done.
