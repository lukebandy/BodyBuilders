Rise and shine! 

It’s a bright morning on the good starship A Peaceful Sleep, soon to arrive back at Earth after a long voyage. 

As the artificial intelligence in charge of looking after the passengers, its time for you to wake them up from cryo sleep and prepa… oh no. Oh noooo.

It seems you got carried away at some point and disassembled all the passengers. 

Earth is approaching quick. 

Can you repair all the humans in time before you reach home and anyone sees what you’ve done?
